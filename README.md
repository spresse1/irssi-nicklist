irssi-nicklist
==============

An updated irssi nicklist script with new abilities.  These include:
* Displaying user information within queries, including user status, online time, idle time, etc.

Installation
============

This script should be simple to install.

1. Copy it to ~/.irssi/scripts.
2. Load in irssi by running /script load nicklist
3. If you wish to have it run automatically on irssi startup, run 'ln -s ~/.irssi/scripts/nicklist.pl ~/.irssi/scripts/autorun/nicklist.pl'

Thank you
=========

This script is a modified version of heeen's nicklist.pl (http://heeen.de/proj/nicklist.txt).  Many thanks are extended to him/her for the origional script.
